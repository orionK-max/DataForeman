- Updates application files
- Runs migrations automatically on next start

### Uninstallation
1. Runs `uninstall.ps1` script
2. Stops Docker containers
3. Prompts user about data removal:

   - **Delete data**: Removes all databases and volumes
4. Removes application files
5. Removes shortcuts

## User Update Process

Users can update DataForeman in two ways:
